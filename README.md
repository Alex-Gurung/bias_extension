# bias_extension
A chrome extension that (naively) highlights words and phrases that may indicate bias on new sites

## Usage
Simply press `shift+s` to highlight, and `shift+w` to undo!

## Note
I can't emphasize enough how naive this extension is, and (at the moment), how little regard it has for wreaking havoc on webpages.
